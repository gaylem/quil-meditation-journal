        <h2>About quil</h2>
        <p>
          {' '}
          <span className='purple'>quil</span> is your distraction-free space for chronicling your meditation journey.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>Sure, you could use any other digital note-taking app instead, but the last thing you need when you&apos;re about to meditate is to glance at your to do list.</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          That&apos;s also why quil also steers clear of social sharing features and alerts. We know that true success in meditation lies in your ability to <span className='purple'>dedicate time and space</span> to your practice.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          And with quil, your meditation journal is with you wherever you go, right on your phone or tablet. No need to remember to grab a notebook â€” you can <span className='purple'>capture and reflect on your mindfulness moments at any time.</span>
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>Safe & Secure</h2>
        <p>We recognize that your meditation journal contains your personal inner experiences and reflections, which is why we take privacy and security very seriously.</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          All journal entries are <span className='purple'>fully encrypted</span>, and we will <span className='purple'>never share or sell your data</span> to third parties. You can meditate with quil knowing your journal is completely confidential and seen only by you.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>Open Source & Free To Use</h2>
        <p>
          quil is also an <span className='purple'>open-source product</span>, which is why we can offer it to the public at no cost. We believe that <span className='purple'>meditation should be free and accessible to everyone</span> who wants to learn regardless of their beliefs (or lack thereof).
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          We also hope that, in addition to sharing the benefits of meditation with others, quil will also foster <span className='purple'>growth and collaboration</span> within the open source software community.
        </p>
        <br />
