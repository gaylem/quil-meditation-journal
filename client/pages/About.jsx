      <h2>About quil</h2>
      <p>
        <span className='purple'>quil</span> is a portmanteau of the words "tranquil" and "quill," like the feather pen. It is your distraction-free space for chronicling your meditation journey.{' '}
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Sure, you could use any other digital note-taking app instead, but the last thing you need when you&apos;re about to meditate is to glance at your to-do list.</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        That&apos;s also why quil steers clear of social sharing features and alerts. We know that true success in meditation lies in your ability to <span className='purple'>dedicate time and space</span> to your practice.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        And with quil, your meditation journal is with you wherever you go, right on your phone or tablet. No need to remember to grab a notebook â€” you can <span className='purple'>capture and reflect on your mindfulness moments at any time.</span>
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h2>Safe & Secure</h2>
      <p>We recognize that your meditation journal contains your personal inner experiences and reflections. That's why we take privacy and security very seriously.</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        All journal entries are <span className='purple'>fully encrypted</span>, and we will <span className='purple'>never share or sell your data</span> to third parties. You can meditate with quil knowing your journal is confidential and seen only by you.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h2>Open Source & Free To Use</h2>
      <p>
        quil is a <span className='purple'>free and open-source product</span> because meditation should be accessible to everyone who wants to learn regardless of their beliefs (or lack thereof).
